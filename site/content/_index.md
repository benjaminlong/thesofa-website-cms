## Welcome to the TheSofa's Lab

The Sofa’s Lab is focused on making technology more accessible, teaching technology topics, and focusing the use of technology on the betterment of society. At the lab we believe that the world is multi-disciplinary. That the best version of the future is built by a wide variety of people with different skills, backgrounds, and ideologies. I am always searching for connections between the sciences, the humanities, law, politics, and all of the other threads that tie humanity together.

We write to inspire, we teach to find inspiration, but above all else we hope to spark a more enlightened and informed conversation about software and its continuing impact on the world.

Enjoy, and never stop learning.
